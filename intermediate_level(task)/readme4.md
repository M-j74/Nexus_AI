Task 4: Optimizing Churn Prediction (Advanced Classification) 
 The "Why": A simple model is a good start, but GlobalMart needs higher accuracy. This 
task is about using more powerful models and evaluation metrics to improve our 
predictive power. 
 Description: Improve upon the churn prediction model from Task 3 using a more 
advanced algorithm and comprehensive evaluation. 
 Step-by-Step Guide: 
1. Feature Scaling: Apply a scaler (like StandardScaler) to your numerical data. 
2. Model Training: Train a more robust model like a Random Forest or XGBoost 
classifier. 
 
 
3. Advanced Evaluation: Evaluate the new model using Precision, Recall, and F1
Score. 
4. Comparison: Compare the performance of this advanced model to the Logistic 
Regression model from Task 3. Explain which model is better for this business 
problem and why. 
 Suggested Dataset: Use the same churn dataset. 
 Expected Outcome: A Jupyter Notebook comparing the two models and providing a 
clear recommendation on which model to deploy, justified by the advanced evaluation 
metrics.
