Focus: Building, training, and evaluating predictive models. 
Task 3: Predicting Customer Churn (Classification) 
 The "Why": It's cheaper to keep a customer than to find a new one. At GlobalMart, we 
want to predict which customers are likely to stop buying from us so we can offer them 
incentives to stay. 
 Description: Build a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn (leave 
the service). 
 Step-by-Step Guide: 
1. Preprocessing: Clean the data and convert categorical features into numerical 
format (using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding). 
2. Train-Test Split: Split your data into training and testing sets. 
3. Model Training: Train a simple yet powerful Logistic Regression model. 
4. Evaluation: Evaluate your model using Accuracy and a Confusion Matrix. 
Explain what the matrix tells you about your model's performance. 
 Suggested Dataset: Telco Customer Churn on Kaggle 
 Expected Outcome: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the entire process, including the 
model's accuracy score and an interpretation of the confusion matrix.
