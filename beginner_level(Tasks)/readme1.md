Part 1: Beginner Level (The Data Analyst) 
Focus: Data manipulation, cleaning, and telling stories with visualizations. 
Task 1: Understanding the Customer's Story (EDA) 
 The "Why": Before we can build complex models, we must first understand our data. 
What are our customers buying? When are they buying it? This initial exploration is the 
foundation of all data science. 
 Description: Perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail 
sales dataset to uncover initial patterns and insights. 
 Step-by-Step Guide: 
1. Load Data: Use Pandas to load the dataset. 
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values (e.g., fill or drop), check for and remove 
duplicates, and correct data types (e.g., convert 'Date' column to datetime objects). 
3. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for 
key numerical columns like Sales and Quantity. 
4. Basic Visualization: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations like: 
 A histogram of customer sales. 
 A bar chart showing sales by product category. 
 A line chart showing sales over time. 
 Suggested Dataset: Online Retail Dataset on Kaggle 
 Expected Outcome: A detailed Jupyter Notebook with clean code, clear visualizations, 
and a summary of at least 5 key business insights discovered from the data.
