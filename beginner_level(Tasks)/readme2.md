Task 2: Visualizing for Impact 
 The "Why": Raw data is messy. A good data analyst presents their findings in a clean, 
easy-to-understand dashboard. This task is about communicating your insights effectively 
to a non-technical audience. 
 Description: Create an interactive dashboard to visualize the key findings from your 
EDA in Task 1. 
 Step-by-Step Guide: 
1. Select Key Metrics: Choose the 3-4 most important insights from Task 1 (e.g., 
top-selling products, sales by country, peak shopping hours). 
2. Build a Dashboard: Use a library like Plotly or Dash (or even Google Data 
Studio for a no-code option) to create an interactive dashboard. 
3. Interactivity: Add features like dropdown menus to filter by country or product 
category. 
4. Presentation: Ensure your dashboard is well-labeled, visually appealing, and tells 
a clear story. 
 Suggested Dataset: Use the cleaned dataset from Task 1. 
 Expected Outcome: A link to a live (or screencast of) an interactive dashboard and the 
corresponding Python script.
