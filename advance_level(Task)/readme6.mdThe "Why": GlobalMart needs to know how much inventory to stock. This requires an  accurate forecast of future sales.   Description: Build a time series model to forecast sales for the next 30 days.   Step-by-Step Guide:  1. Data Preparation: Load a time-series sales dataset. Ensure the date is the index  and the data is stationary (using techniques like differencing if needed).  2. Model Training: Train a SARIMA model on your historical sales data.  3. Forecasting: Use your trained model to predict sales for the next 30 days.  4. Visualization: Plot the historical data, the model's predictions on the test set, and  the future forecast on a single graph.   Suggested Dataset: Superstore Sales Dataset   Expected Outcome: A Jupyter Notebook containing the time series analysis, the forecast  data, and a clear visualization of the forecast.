The "Why": GlobalMart needs to know how much inventory to stock. This requires an 
accurate forecast of future sales. 
 Description: Build a time series model to forecast sales for the next 30 days. 
 Step-by-Step Guide: 
1. Data Preparation: Load a time-series sales dataset. Ensure the date is the index 
and the data is stationary (using techniques like differencing if needed). 
2. Model Training: Train a SARIMA model on your historical sales data. 
3. Forecasting: Use your trained model to predict sales for the next 30 days. 
4. Visualization: Plot the historical data, the model's predictions on the test set, and 
the future forecast on a single graph. 
 Suggested Dataset: Superstore Sales Dataset 
 Expected Outcome: A Jupyter Notebook containing the time series analysis, the forecast 
data, and a clear visualization of the forecast.
